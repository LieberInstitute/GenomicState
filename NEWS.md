# GenomicState 0.99.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added the functions `gencode_txdb()`, `gencode_annotated_genes()` and
`gencode_genomic_state()` for creating GenomicState objects from Gencode
annotation files for human genome versions hg38 and hg19.
* Added `local_metadata()` for finding the data locally, particularly at
JHPCE.
