This package provides functions for building `GenomicState` objects from
diverse annotation sources such as
[`Gencode`](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/releases.html). It also
provides a way to load pre-computed `GenomicState` objects if you are
working at [JHPCE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/). These `GenomicState` objects
are normally created using
[derfinder::makeGenomicState()](http://lcolladotor.github.io/derfinder/reference/makeGenomicState.html)
and can be used for annotating regions with
[derfinder::annotateRegions()](http://lcolladotor.github.io/derfinder/reference/annotateRegions.html)
which are in turn used by
[derfinderPlot::plotRegionCoverage()](http://leekgroup.github.io/derfinderPlot/reference/plotRegionCoverage.html).

## Documentation

For more information about `GenomicState` check the vignettes [through
Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/GenomicState) or at the
[documentation website](http://lieberinstitute.github.io/GenomicState).

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `GenomicState` from
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("GenomicState")
```

## Citation

Below is the citation output from using `citation('GenomicState')` in R.
Please run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite
**GenomicState**.

``` r
print(citation("GenomicState"), bibtex = TRUE)

Please note that the `GenomicState` was only made possible thanks to
many other R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either
in the vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.
